@article{Kim2003,
abstract = {Support vector machines (SVMs) are promising methods for the prediction of financial time-series because they use a risk function consisting of the empirical error and a regularized term which is derived from the structural risk minimization principle. This study applies SVM to predicting the stock price index. In addition, this study examines the feasibility of applying SVM in financial forecasting by comparing it with back-propagation neural networks and case-based reasoning. The experimental results show that SVM provides a promising alternative to stock market prediction.},

As the input, several technical indicators and statistical measures are selected. In order to conduct appropriate verification dedicated system with the ability to proceed walk-forward testing was designed and developed. In conjunction with modified SVM classifier, we use Fishers method for feature selection. The outcome shows that using the example weighting combined with feature selection significantly improves sample trading strategy results in terms of the overall rate of return, as well as maximum drawdown during a trading period.},
